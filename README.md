# Mine-Sweeper-Game
This is the implementation of mine sweeper game in C++.
In this project, I was assigned to make mine sweeper game backend in C++. I was designed and made this game console based.
There were two major things in that project. First one was setting the numbers for any block according to the number of
bombs in its neighbor blocks. Second problem was if the user opens a block with zero in it, then open all the neighbor
blocks till non-zero block or bomb block.
I used my problem-solving skill and I solve these two problems using recursion. I was an amazing learning experience. I really enjoyed this project.
